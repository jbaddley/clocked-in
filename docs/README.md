VolunTime is one multi-tenant deployment. Each community, including CASWJ and any sister organization, is a tenant at `{slug}.{APP_HOST}`. CASWJ does not own the deployment and does not need a path on wjarts.org. See the [portal runbook](ops/caswj-portal.md).

Handwritten duration and total hours require a project and a task category. The timer may stay unclassified. Paid rates are gross pay with zero in-kind and an admin-only payroll report. The Staff role stays available to every organization. Public needs stay at `/openings/{publicSlug}`.
